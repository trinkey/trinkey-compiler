# Trinkey compiler
Compiler and documentation for the .trinkey language/file

This is a very basic programming language made to mimic TI-Basic with its basic structure, however without the limitations of being a calculator.

To compile a file, run the compiler and enter the path, and it will output a `{filename}.py` file. Make sure the file extension is `.trinkey`.

There is are example tic tac toe and connect 4 files in this repository just to show basic functionality. (I copied the code from my calculator)
